For **stable** versions instead of nightly or development please read **README** from the **production** branch!

| tag | Branch | Example | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `latest` | production | `ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:latest` or `ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy` | stable as possbile get bug fixes quickly when needed, deployed against `production`. |
| `13` | production | `ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:13` | same as latest, stick to a version tag. |
| `nightly` | master | `ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:nightly` | mostly unstable gets frequent package and code updates, deployed against `master`. |
| `development` | pull requests | `ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:development` | used for development, testing code from PRs before landing into `master`. |

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
exit
```

And log in again.

### 2. Run WireGuard Easy

To automatically install & run wg-easy, simply run:

```
  docker run -d \
  --name=wg-easy \
  -e LANG=de \
  -e WG_HOST=<ðŸš¨YOUR_SERVER_IP> \
  -e PASSWORD_HASH=<ðŸš¨YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH> \
  -e PORT=51821 \
  -e WG_PORT=51820 \
  -v ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard \
  -p 51820:51820/udp \
  -p 51821:51821/tcp \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
  --sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1" \
  --sysctl="net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
```

>
> ðŸ’¡ Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` with a bcrypt password hash to log in on the Web UI. See [How_to_generate_an_bcrypt_hash.md](./How_to_generate_an_bcrypt_hash.md) for know how generate the hash.

docker run ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:nightly wgpw PASSWORD

## Updating

To update to the latest version, simply run:

```bash
docker stop wg-easy
docker rm wg-easy
docker pull ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
```

And then run the `docker run -d \ ...` command above again.

With Docker Compose WireGuard Easy can be updated with a single command:
`docker compose up --detach --pull always` (if an image tag is specified in the
Compose file and it is not `latest`, make sure that it is changed to the desired
one; by default it is omitted and
[defaults to `latest`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#image-references)). \
The WireGuared Easy container will be automatically recreated if a newer image
was pulled.
